# CodingKatas

This is a personal project where I do various exercises of varying difficulty in an attemp to hone my programming skills.  Each "kata" is an isolated project that will usually consist of the code and a set of xUnit tests.  Some projects may be further separated into other projects, like class libraries, but they will all have the same prefix.
