# CodingKatas

This is a personal project where I do various exercises of varying difficulty in an attemp to hone my programming skills.  Each "kata" is an isolated project that will usually consist of the code and a set of xUnit tests.  Some projects may be further separated into other projects, like class libraries, but they will all have the same prefix.

## Katas

 - [FizzBuzz](./tree/master/FizzBuzz) - is an exercise in which a program must count from 1 or 100 (or some other arbitray range) and output a string based on the current number.  The program emits _Fizz_ when the number is divisible by 3, _Buzz_ when by 5, and _FizzBuzz_ when divisible by three and five. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)
