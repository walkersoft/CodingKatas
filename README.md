# CodingKatas

This is a personal project where I do various exercises of varying difficulty in an attemp to hone my programming skills.  Each "kata" is an isolated project that will usually consist of the code and a set of xUnit tests.  Some projects may be further separated into other projects, like class libraries, but they will all have the same prefix.

## Katas

 - **Console Bowling** ([Code](/ConsoleBowling) | [Tests](/ConsoleBowling.Tests) | [Download](/releases/tag/1.0)) - Based on Uncle Bob's exercise about using TDD to create a program that can calculate a bowling score. This little app not only implements a set of tests to do just that, but it also comes with a console app where you can play a game of bowling as well.

 - **FizzBuzz** ([Code](/FizzBuzz) | [Tests](/FizzBuzz.Tests)) - An exercise in which a program counts from 1 or 100 (or some other arbitray range) and output a string based on the current number.  The program emits _Fizz_ when the number is divisible by 3, _Buzz_ when divisible by 5, and _FizzBuzz_ when divisible by both 3 and 5. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)
